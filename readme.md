# Abstractive and Extractive Summarization
<h1>Project Details</h1>

<h2>Bachelor's Degree Final Year Project</h2>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project represents the culmination of the Bachelor's degree and focuses on abstractive and extractive summarization. For abstractive summarization, a deep learning neural network was trained on the CNN/Dailymail dataset using bidirectional LSTM. The model was designed to perform text summarization tasks using a machine translation algorithm. For extractive summarization, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was employed to generate summaries of generic text. The entire system was developed using Python Flask and connected to a C# n-tier application for Windows, facilitating communication between the backend and frontend components.</p>

<h2>Components and Techniques Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Abstractive Summarization:</strong> Trained a deep learning neural network with bidirectional LSTM on the CNN/Dailymail dataset for text summarization using a machine translation approach.</li>
    <li><strong>Extractive Summarization:</strong> Utilized Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to create summaries of generic text using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).</li>
    <li><strong>Development Stack:</strong> Implemented the project in Python Flask for the backend and connected it to a C# n-tier application for Windows to manage the frontend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Outcome</h2>
<p>The final year project successfully combines abstractive and extractive summarization techniques, demonstrating proficiency in natural language processing and machine learning. The integration with a C# n-tier application ensures a user-friendly interface and seamless interaction between the user and the summarization algorithms.</p>
